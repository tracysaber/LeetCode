 * Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, sb, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

 Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

 For example, given array S = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

 A solution set is:
 [
 [-1,  0, 0, 1],
 [-2, -1, 1, 2],
 [-2,  0, 0, 2]
 ]
